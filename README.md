# Sinthesys

Biologically-inspired neural network research project that implements adaptive learning mechanisms based on concepts from neuroscience and systems biology. The system demonstrates how homeostatic regulation, dual-timescale memory consolidation, and attentional gating can create self-regulating learning behavior in artificial neural networks.
